#Challenge 2: Portfolio

## User Story

- I want a portfolio page which showcases my web development skills in the form of a number of different projects.

- This page should highlight my strongest work and the thought processes behind it. 

- This page should have the space to link to several deployed projects that potential employers can view.

- Elements of the page should be build using Bootstrap components where possible to make code simpler.

## Results

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, my skills, and how to contact me.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* The section about me contains a photo and a link to download my resume displayed in a jumbotron component.
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications using Bootstrap cards and a grid layout.
* When the button under each application is clicked then the user is/WILL BE taken to that deployed application.
* The skills section contains a list of skills that darkens on hover.
* The contact section has buttons for email, linkedin, and github which darken and throw a shadow on hover.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
